 A 4-inch screen is used for the PiCamera([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBVF1C9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [the driver link](http://www.lcdwiki.com/4inch_HDMI_Display-C)).

 The first version is based on the tutorial for [Tkinter with video feed](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/30/displaying-a-video-feed-with-opencv-and-tkinter/).

 Here is a tutorial for [starting GUI program on boot](https://medium.com/@arslion/starting-python-gui-program-on-raspberry-pi-startup-56fb4e451cc1).
